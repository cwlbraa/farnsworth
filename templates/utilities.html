		<li>You can log out and login as the anonymous user (username "{{ ANONYMOUS_USERNAME }}").
		It is recommended that you only do this on common space computers.
		If logged in as the anonymous user on another machine, you can logout by visiting {{ logout_url }} on that machine.
		<ul><li>Login as the anonymous user "{{ ANONYMOUS_USERNAME }}": <a class="page_link" href="{% url 'anonymous_login' %}"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-log-out"></span> Anonymous Login</a></li></ul>
		</li>
		<li>Sometimes (especially if you used the Django admin), the number of request responses and thread messages stored in their model fields can be different from the real value.
		If this is the case, or you're not sure, you can recount both these fields for each request and thread.
		It is advised that you do this every few weeks.
		Running this utility will not modify the change date on either requests or threads.
		<ul><li>Recount request responses and thread messages: <a class="page_link" href="{% url 'recount' %}"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-repeat"></span> Recount</a></li></ul>
		</li>
		<li>You can alternatively go to the Django admin interface for more low-level control.
		This is highly not recommended and only advised if you wrote Farnsworth or can rewrite it completely yourself.
		Be careful.  If you fuck up real bad, contact Karandeep through <a class="page_link" href="//github.com/knagra" target="_blank">his GitHub page</a>.
