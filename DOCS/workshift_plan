[DONE] Semester ("Summer" | "Fall" | "Spring"), Year, start date, end date, workshift rate, preferences_open)

	"Humor Hours, Workshift Manager, 2 hours, every six weeks"

WorkshiftType (title [unique], description of duties, default hours, show_in_preferences boolean).

	For preferences, delete these at end of semester

WorkshiftProfile (user foreign key, Semester, timeblocks, workshift ratings, weekly hours required [pre-fill], standing, hour adjustment, manager note,

		[(30 July 2014, +250 hours), (15 August 2014, +500 hours)])"
