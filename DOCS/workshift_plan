Modify Manager model to hold summer and semester hours per week fields.  Toggle giving workshift by active status.

Semester ("Summer" | "Fall" | "Spring", Year, Workshift Managers [manytomany Manager], default required hours, fine rate)
	Unique together: "Fall" etc. & Year
	e.g., "Summer, 2014, So-and-So workshift manager, 5 hours per week standard, 13.30"

WorkshiftType (title [unique], description of duties, default hours, show_in_preferences boolean).
	Use these for preference selection and to standardize changes to workshift descriptions.
	e.g., "Pots, clean all the pots, 2 hours by default [can be changed upon instantiation of workshift], active"

TimeBlock ("Busy" | "Free" | "Preferred", start time, end time)
	For preferences, delete these at end of semester
	e.g., "Busy Monday 8AM-6PM"
